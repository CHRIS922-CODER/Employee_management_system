from django.contrib.auth.views import PasswordResetView, PasswordResetDoneView, PasswordResetConfirmView, PasswordResetCompleteView
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    # Password Reset
    path('password_reset/', PasswordResetView.as_view(), name='password_reset'),
    path('password_reset/done/', PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(), name='password_reset_done'),
    path('reset/<uidb64>/<token>/', PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(), name='password_reset_confirm'),
    path('reset/done/', PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(), name='password_reset_complete'),
]


from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),  # Include authentication URLs
    # Add your other app URLs here
]


By including 'django.contrib.auth.urls', you're including Django's built-in authentication views, including the password reset views you defined earlier.


Templates (Optional):

Ensure that you have the necessary HTML templates in place for the password reset views.
 Django's built-in views use templates with specific names, so you should have templates named like registration/password_reset_form.html, registration/password_reset_done.html, registration/password_reset_confirm.html, and registration/password_reset_complete.html. Customize these templates according to your project's styling and requirements.

Email Configuration (Optional):

To send email notifications for password reset requests, configure your email settings in Django's settings.py file.
 You'll need to specify the SMTP server, port, email account credentials, and other email-related settings.

EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'your-smtp-server.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587  # Example port for SMTP
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'


With these steps, your Django project should have the necessary views and URLs to handle forgotten passwords and reset requests.
 Users can access the password reset functionality through the /accounts/password_reset/ URL, and Django will guide them through the process via the built-in views and templates.




Sure, I can help you generate views and URLs for a CRUD application for the Department model and its related Role model. You'll need to create views for both creating and managing departments and roles. Here's how you can do it:



from django.shortcuts import render, redirect, get_object_or_404
from .models import Department, Role
from .forms import DepartmentForm, RoleForm

# Department Views
def department_list(request):
    departments = Department.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'department/department_list.html', {'departments': departments})

def department_detail(request, pk):
    department = get_object_or_404(Department, pk=pk)
    return render(request, 'department/department_detail.html', {'department': department})

def department_create(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = DepartmentForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('department_list')
    else:
        form = DepartmentForm()
    return render(request, 'department/department_form.html', {'form': form})

def department_update(request, pk):
    department = get_object_or_404(Department, pk=pk)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = DepartmentForm(request.POST, instance=department)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('department_list')
    else:
        form = DepartmentForm(instance=department)
    return render(request, 'department/department_form.html', {'form': form})

def department_delete(request, pk):
    department = get_object_or_404(Department, pk=pk)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        department.delete()
        return redirect('department_list')
    return render(request, 'department/department_confirm_delete.html', {'department': department})

# Role Views
def role_list(request, department_id):
    department = get_object_or_404(Department, pk=department_id)
    roles = department.role_set.all()
    return render(request, 'department/role_list.html', {'department': department, 'roles': roles})

def role_detail(request, department_id, role_id):
    department = get_object_or_404(Department, pk=department_id)
    role = get_object_or_404(Role, pk=role_id, department=department)
    return render(request, 'department/role_detail.html', {'department': department, 'role': role})

def role_create(request, department_id):
    department = get_object_or_404(Department, pk=department_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = RoleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            role = form.save(commit=False)
            role.department = department
            role.save()
            return redirect('role_list', department_id=department_id)
    else:
        form = RoleForm()
    return render(request, 'department/role_form.html', {'department': department, 'form': form})

def role_update(request, department_id, role_id):
    department = get_object_or_404(Department, pk=department_id)
    role = get_object_or_404(Role, pk=role_id, department=department)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = RoleForm(request.POST, instance=role)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('role_list', department_id=department_id)
    else:
        form = RoleForm(instance=role)
    return render(request, 'department/role_form.html', {'department': department, 'form': form})

def role_delete(request, department_id, role_id):
    department = get_object_or_404(Department, pk=department_id)
    role = get_object_or_404(Role, pk=role_id, department=department)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        role.delete()
        return redirect('role_list', department_id=department_id)
    return render(request, 'department/role_confirm_delete.html', {'department': department, 'role': role})




from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # Department URLs
    path('departments/', views.department_list, name='department_list'),
    path('department/<int:pk>/', views.department_detail, name='department_detail'),
    path('department/create/', views.department_create, name='department_create'),
    path('department/<int:pk>/update/', views.department_update, name='department_update'),
    path('department/<int:pk>/delete/', views.department_delete, name='department_delete'),
    
    # Role URLs
    path('department/<int:department_id>/roles/', views.role_list, name='role_list'),
    path('department/<int:department_id>/role/<int:role_id>/', views.role_detail, name='role_detail'),
    path('department/<int:department_id>/role/create/', views.role_create, name='role_create'),
    path('department/<int:department_id>/role/<int:role_id>/update/', views.role_update, name='role_update'),
    path('department/<int:department_id>/role/<int:role_id>/delete/', views.role_delete, name='role_delete'),
]




Implementing a notification system in Django involves several components, including a Notification model, views for generating and managing notifications, templates for displaying notifications, and logic for handling notifications. Here's a step-by-step guide with code and comments for each section:

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.utils import timezone

class Notification(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='notifications')
    message = models.TextField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    is_read = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.message



Views for Generating and Managing Notifications (views.py):

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .models import Notification

def create_notification(user, message):
    Notification.objects.create(user=user, message=message)

def view_notifications(request):
    user = request.user
    notifications = user.notifications.all().order_by('-timestamp')
    return render(request, 'notifications/view_notifications.html', {'notifications': notifications})

def mark_notification_as_read(request, notification_id):
    notification = Notification.objects.get(id=notification_id)
    if notification.user == request.user:
        notification.is_read = True
        notification.save()
    return redirect('view_notifications')


create_notification: Function to create a new notification for a user.
view_notifications: View to display a user's notifications.
mark_notification_as_read: View to mark a notification as read.
3. Templates for Notifications (view_notifications.html):

{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Notifications</h1>
  <ul>
    {% for notification in notifications %}
      <li{% if notification.is_read %} style="color: #999;"{% endif %}>
        {{ notification.message }}
        <small>{{ notification.timestamp }}</small>
        {% if not notification.is_read %}
          <a href="{% url 'mark_notification_as_read' notification.id %}">Mark as Read</a>
        {% endif %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endblock %}


4. URL Patterns (urls.py):
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('notifications/', views.view_notifications, name='view_notifications'),
    path('notifications/mark_as_read/<int:notification_id>/', views.mark_notification_as_read, name='mark_notification_as_read'),
]

5. Notification Handling Logic:

Whenever an event occurs that requires generating a notification (e.g., leave request approval), call the create_notification function to create a new notification for the user associated with that event.

Here's an example of how to use create_notification:

# Inside your views or wherever the event occurs
create_notification(request.user, "Your leave request has been approved.")
This code creates a notification for the logged-in user with the specified message.

Note: You can integrate create_notification into various parts of your application where notifications are needed.

With this setup, you have a basic notification system in Django that allows users to view and mark notifications as read. You can extend this system to include more complex features like real-time notifications using Django Channels, grouping notifications, or allowing users to subscribe/unsubscribe from certain types of notifications.
